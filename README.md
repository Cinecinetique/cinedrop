#Goal

The goal of this project is to provide an online platform where all the team members and partners involved in the production of films and videos can exchange files and track their changes.

It is primarily aimed at films and multimedia/transmedia students, film schools and small video/transmedia production teams.


#Status

First Prototype (uses Rails 4, SQLite and Firebase with deployment on AWS EC2)

Has been user-tested with the film department of an international high school.

Development is currently paused.

#Plan

* decouple from AWS or abstract AWS layer at least
* Make it a native app on Desktop (investigate using Fire Grass Computing Platform?) and mobile (native iOs app)
